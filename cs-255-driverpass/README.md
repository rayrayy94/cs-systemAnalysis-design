# CS-255 DriverPass Project
Reflection and documentation for DriverPass project.

---

## Reflection

**1) Client & system summary**  
The client, DriverPass, needed a system that would allow students to schedule driving lessons, access online practice tests, and manage packages. The system required both an online interface for customers and administrative tools for staff to track scheduling, instructors, and student progress.  

**2) What I did well**  
I did well in documenting the functional and non-functional requirements clearly, especially the scheduling features and the security considerations for user data. I also feel my system design diagrams communicated the structure of the application effectively.  

**3) What I would revise**  
If I could revise one part, I would add more detail to the cost and implementation considerations. This would make the design more practical for real-world deployment and easier to estimate resources.  

**4) Interpreting user needs**  
I translated the interview notes and client feedback into specific requirements, such as limiting overlapping schedules, ensuring instructors could manage their availability, and giving students mobile-friendly access. Considering user needs is essential because it keeps the design focused on solving the actual problem instead of adding unnecessary complexity.  

**5) My design approach & future strategies**  
I approached this project by first gathering requirements, then modeling the system with UML diagrams, and finally recommending a layered architecture. In the future, I would continue using UML and requirements analysis but also add prototyping and stakeholder feedback sessions to catch issues earlier and refine the design more effectively.
